# OpticalFlow
Optical flow and perception of movement

In this project, the main focus is to study the relation between Optical flow and the perception of movement for the human being.  

The study has been conducted by analyzing what is important for the human eye and brain in order to detect movment and which of those information are extracted unconsciously by the brain in real time.
            
The final part of the study consisted in the extraction of the optical flow from a stock video using 2 different algorithms: Lucas-Kanade and Farneback.
Each algorithm has been implemented in <span>Python</span> and the results are plotted once the extraction ends.
